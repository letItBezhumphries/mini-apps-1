The client app should be able to submit JSON data to the server, 
receive a response containing a CSV-formatted result 
(the way this is done will vary depending on where you are in the challenge).

Do not use any external libraries (such as via npm). You may use jQuery on the client.
*/

//The response from the server should contain the CSV report along with the form so the user can keep submitting indefinitely, 
//without having to go back to the "form page"

//When the user clicks submit, POST the form data to the server.
//The form submission process should use the default browser action/behavior.
